# Handoff

One entry per milestone: what was verified, how, and where ("xemu" results
are emulator-only; timing, audio, memory and HDD latency are judged on the
console).

## M0: skeleton, toolchain, the tool's shape (2026-10-16, branch `dev`)

Built on Windows 11 with MSYS2 (clang 21.1.8), nxdk `58427c0`, N64Recomp
`ffb39cd`; run in xemu 0.8.136 (slot 9, 64 MB, HDTV AV pack, 480i dashboard).

**Verified**

- `n64rx doctor` on this machine: native engine ready (MSYS2, LLVM 21,
  cmake, ninja, nxdk at the pin, N64Recomp), Docker "not installed" with the
  install hint. The "no Docker" verdict is also covered by `test_n64rx.py`.
- `n64rx build build-host/test/test.z64` (the test ROM, `make_test_rom.py`)
  through the native engine: ROM read and matched by SHA-1, N64Recomp (5
  functions), the register scan (32-bit), the compile (`--fast` and ThinLTO),
  the XBE pass (title ID `4E52FFFE`, `$$XTIMAGE`, `default.tbn`), the output
  folder. A second build with the same inputs skips the recompile.
- xemu, the test pack: loading screen, "Preparing memory", "Loading code",
  "Starting N64Recomp-X test", then **"Test ROM: passed", 34 checks, 0 failed**
  with 32-bit registers (`--fast`) and with 64-bit registers under ThinLTO
  (`--gpr 64`). `[RECOMP] window: 4 MB, physical 03a31000`.
- xemu, the platform alone: the loading screen and the "No game built in"
  card; `[FBDUMP]` baselines with `-DXHW_SPLASH_STILL=1` in
  `docs/look/loading-480i-still.png` and `docs/look/card-no-game-still.png`.
- xemu, scripted input (autopad, `t<ms>` events): BACK held during the
  loading screen -> `[SETTINGS] BACK held at boot: 480i 4:3 (saved)`, and the
  next boot reads 480i; BACK + START -> `[SETTINGS] reset at boot (BACK +
  START): defaults` plus 480i; L + R + BACK + BLACK on the card -> `[PAD] port
  1: L + R + BACK + BLACK`, dashboard, and the next boot logs `[BOOT] previous
  exit: quit to the dashboard: L + R + BACK + BLACK on port 1`; the same combo
  (300 ms press) on the loading screen; L + R + BACK + WHITE -> restart, and
  the next boot logs `previous exit: restart: L + R + BACK + WHITE on port 1`.
- Host tests on Windows (MSYS2 clang as the host compiler): `test_pad_combo`
  35 checks, `test_splash` 29, `test_settings` 16, `test_n64rx` 11 tests,
  `rom_leak_check` clean.
- `tools/xbox/setup.sh` on Windows (MSYS2 path): installs the missing
  pacman packages, finds nxdk and N64Recomp built.
- Console variants (PLAN.md 3.13), xemu: at 64 MB `[MEM] boot: 65536 KB of
  RAM, nothing to hold (64 MB console)`, `[CLOCK] cpu 733 MHz (TSC against
  the ACPI timer, 3375000 Hz)`. With `mem_limit = '128'` (`-m 128`) the
  kernel still gives the XBE 64 MB (this BIOS honours cxbe's 64 MB-limit
  flag): the same `[MEM]` line, the console runs as 64 MB. Not exercised:
  `xhw_ram_lock64`'s hold path (a kernel that hands out the upper half
  anyway) and an upgraded CPU (xemu has neither); the console runs of §3.13.

**Not verified (and why)**

- Linux and macOS: no such machine here. `setup.sh`'s apt and Homebrew paths,
  the native engine there, and the host tests with `cc` are written but
  unrun until CI runs them (`.github/workflows/build.yml`, three-OS matrix).
- CI: the workflow is written; it runs once `dev` is pushed (not pushed:
  pushing waits for the maintainer).
- Docker: not installed here. The Dockerfile (multi-arch, N64Recomp inside),
  the Docker engine and the GHCR push job are unbuilt; the image is not on
  GHCR yet.
- The watchdog's last-resort combo look: covered by `test_pad_combo` (the
  timer) and wired in `xhw_watchdog.c`, but no xemu scenario stalls every
  other look in M0 (there is no VI thread yet; M1).
- The console (red, gold): nothing of M0 has run on hardware. Worth checking
  first there: the loading screen's frame cost (`[BOOT] loading screen: N ms a
  frame` in a test build), the controllers' bring-up time, interlace flicker
  on the light sweep and the sparks at 480i.

**Known gaps carried into M1**

- `xhw_rom.c` is still Wings64-X's (Pilotwings 64's size and table); the
  runtime does not read a ROM yet. M1 generalises it to the pack's table.
- No libultra entry points, no VI thread, no boot block or boot copy (M1).
- `test_recomp_h` (our header against upstream's on the host) is M1's.
